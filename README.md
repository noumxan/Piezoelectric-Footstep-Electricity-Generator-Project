# Piezoelectric Footstep Generating Tile

## Overview:
Our team has developed an innovative piezoelectric footstep generating tile that plays melodic notes with each step. This cutting-edge technology converts mechanical energy from footsteps into electrical energy, which is then stored in a battery and used to power an Arduino for serial communication. This project aims to promote fitness and sustainability by generating renewable energy in parks and public spaces.

## Features:
- **Piezoelectric Energy Generation**: Each tile is equipped with 12 piezoelectric materials (6 on each side).
- **Energy Conversion and Storage**: AC voltage generated by the piezoelectric materials is converted to DC using a bridge rectifier and stored in a 3.5V battery.
- **Interactive Experience**: Force Sensitive Resistors (FSRs) connected to speakers play melodic notes with each step, creating a fun and engaging user experience.
- **Renewable Energy Source**: Promotes sustainability by generating renewable energy from human activity.
- **Power Management**: The stored energy powers a mini power bank circuit, which in turn powers an Arduino for handling additional functionalities, including an LCD display.

## Specifications:
- **Number of Tiles**: 4
- **Piezoelectric Materials per Tile**: 12 (6 on each side)
- **Voltage Output per Tile**: 0.2V to 1.7V
- **Battery**: 3.5V rechargeable battery
- **FSRs**: Connected to speakers for melodic output
- **Mini Power Bank Circuit**: Used to power an additional Arduino
- **LCD Screen**: Displays system functions and statuses

## How It Works:
- **Energy Generation**: Each footstep compresses the piezoelectric materials, generating an AC voltage.
- **Energy Conversion**: The AC voltage is converted to DC using a bridge rectifier.
- **Energy Storage**: The DC voltage is stored in a 3.5V rechargeable battery.
- **Powering the System**: The stored energy powers a mini power bank circuit, which powers an Arduino.
- **Interactive Feedback**: FSRs detect the footsteps and trigger melodic notes through speakers. The Arduino also updates an LCD display with system statuses.

## Components:
- Piezoelectric materials
- Bridge rectifier
- 3.5V rechargeable battery
- Mini power bank circuit
- Arduino
- Force Sensitive Resistors (FSRs)
- Speakers
- LCD screen

## Installation:
- **Hardware Setup**: Place the tiles in the desired location. Connect the piezoelectric materials to the bridge rectifier and the rectifier to the battery.
- **Power Management Setup**: Connect the battery to the mini power bank circuit, and the circuit to the Arduino.
- **Sensor and Output Setup**: Connect the FSRs to the Arduino and speakers. Also, connect the LCD screen to the Arduino.
- **Arduino Setup**: Upload the Arduino code provided in this repository.
- **Testing**: Step on the tiles to ensure the system plays melodic notes, generates and stores voltage, and displays correct information on the LCD screen.

## Arduino Code:
The Arduino code reads the sensor values from the FSRs, maps the sensor values to frequencies, and plays the corresponding notes through the speakers. The code also updates an LCD display with the sensor status and the count of steps.

## Usage:
- **Public Spaces**: Install the tiles in parks, playgrounds, or any public area to promote fitness and generate renewable energy.
- **Interactive Exhibits**: Use the tiles in museums or science centers as an educational tool to demonstrate renewable energy concepts.
- **Fitness Trails**: Enhance fitness trails by providing an interactive and sustainable way to generate energy while exercising.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Increased Energy Efficiency**: Explore ways to increase the voltage output and efficiency of the piezoelectric materials.
- **Data Logging**: Add functionality to log data on energy generation and usage.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Develop a mobile app to display real-time data on energy generation and usage.
